# UI-UX-Experiment5

## Aim:
To understand and apply the process of identifying user problems, selecting appropriate UX research methods, and creating user personas by designing and analyzing two different UX project scenarios — one being a NeoBank Smart Banking App and the other a Government Service Portal — in order to improve usability, accessibility, and overall user experience.

## Algorithm:
```
Start the Experiment.

Identify the Project Scenarios:

Scenario 1: NeoBank – Smart Banking App.

Scenario 2: SmartGov – Government Service Portal.

Define User Problems:

Gather key pain points users face in each scenario.

Write clear UX problem statements using the given format.

Select Suitable Research Methods:

Choose appropriate UX research techniques such as surveys, interviews, or usability testing.

Justify why each method is suitable for the scenario.

Create User Personas:

Analyze user data or assume realistic user types.

Define each persona’s demographics, goals, behaviors, pain points, and motivations.

Design Wireframes or Interface Mockups (Optional):

For NeoBank, create a visually appealing dashboard showing balance, insights, and spending summary.

Analyze and Document Findings:

Compare how UX methods improve the usability of each scenario.

Prepare Final Report:

Include aim, algorithm, problem statements, research methods, personas, and screenshots.

Upload the Files:

Commit and push the lab report PDF and project files to the GitHub repository.

End.
